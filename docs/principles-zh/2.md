# _Principles_《原则》

### by Ray Dalio

### 雷.达里奥 著

What follows are three distinct parts that can be read either independently or as a connected whole. Part 1 is about the purpose and importance of having principles in general, having nothing to do with mine. Part 2 explains my most fundamental life principles that apply to everything I do. Part 3, explains my management principles as they are being lived out at Bridgewater. Since my management principles are simply my most fundamental life principles applied to management, reading Part 2 will help you to better understand Part 3, but it’s not required—you can go directly to Part 3 to see what my management principles are and how Bridgewater has been run. One day I’d like to write a Part 4 on my investment principles. If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck (i.e., understanding for the effort), I suggest that you read Parts 1 and 2, and the beginning of Part 3 (through the Summary and Table of Principles) which will give you nearly the whole picture. It’s only about 55 pages of a normal size book.

本书分为三个章节，可单独阅读每个章节，也可以从头读到尾。第一章整体讲述了有原则的目的和重要性，这些和我自己的原则无关。第二章阐述了围绕我生活方方面面的最重要的根本原则。第三章详述了我管理桥水联合基金公司时遵循的管理原则。我的管理原则其实就是根本生活原则在管理领域的应用，因此阅读第二章将有助于对第三章的理解。当然，你也可以直接阅读第三章，看看我都有哪些管理原则，桥水联合基金是如何基于这些原则进行管理的。未来有一天，我可能会写第四章，聊聊我在投资领域的原则。如果你想尽快读到最多的干货，建议你读第一章和第二章后，阅读第三章从总结到原则汇总列表的内容，这些一共也就正常书籍大小的55页，涵盖了全书的精华。

Above all else, I want you to think for yourself—to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true and 3) what to do about it. I want you to do that in a clear-headed thoughtful way, so that you get what you want. I wrote this book to help you do that. I am going to ask only two things of you—1) that you be open-minded and 2) that you honestly answer some questions about what you want, what is true and what you want to do about it. If you do these things, I believe that you will get a lot out of this book. If you can’t do these things, you should reflect on why that is, because you probably have discovered one of your greatest impediments to getting what you want out of life.

除此之外，也请你想想：

1）你想要什么？

2）真实情况是怎样的？

3）如何应对？

希望你能头脑清晰地想一下，以得到你想要的东西。我写这本书就是为了实现这个目的。我只对你们提两个要求：

1）思想要开放。

2）当我问到你想要什么，真实情况是怎样的，以及你想如何处理时，请诚实回答这些问题。

若你按我说的做了，我相信你能从书中受益良多。如果你做不到这些，就该想想为什么做不到，因为这样你就可能会发现阻碍自己成功的最大障碍了。
